# Django Finite Stte Machines
This is just me working through an example of using the
django-fsm extension as it applies to a manufacturing
administration application.

## Motivation
I"ve been building applications for various types of admin
work for a while and I realize this is something I need to
explore.  I really love working with Django and I would like
to adopt some of the really great extensions people have
built.
